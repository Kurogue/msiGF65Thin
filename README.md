# Overview

These are the dotfiles for my bare metal install of arch linux on my MSI GF65 Thin laptop. I do not have a compositor and do not plan on adding one unless I experience screen tearing. The window manager in use is i3-gaps, using feh for setting the wallpaper and pywal for the colorscheme generated.
